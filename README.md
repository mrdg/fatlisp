# Fatlisp

Simple Lisp interpreter. It can be embedded in Go programs,
but there is also a stand-alone executable.

For an example on how to use it in a Go program, check
[fli/main.go](fli/main.go).

The standalone version is used like this:

```
fli <filename>
```

__Note__ it's not really useful yet. A lot of stuff is still missing.
